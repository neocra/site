//Developing a software is like make Ã  parachute jump. Test, verify, make security and go prod
  //Learn from past, make the present, and live in future.
  //Each day a line. In few days a software. 
  //Life is coded ? So there have bugs !
  //Code, refactor, code, refactor... It's the life.
  //Nothing on monday is not nothing on a sprint.
  //All opportunities are great. Choice one to make the best
  //Understand, learn, code, repeat.
  //Code is like sport, practice more and more to be at the first place
